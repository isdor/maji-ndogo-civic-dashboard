Maji Ndogo Civic Indicators Dashboard (Power BI)
This repository hosts a professional Power BI project file (class project.pbix) containing a comprehensive visual analysis of key civic indicators for the country of Maji Ndogo.

The dashboard provides localized insights into:

Public Safety: Detailed analysis and visualization of regional crime rates and trends.

Environmental Health: Metrics related to pollution and other environmental indicators across Maji Ndogo.

Socio-Economic Metrics: Cross-analysis incorporating national demographic and socio-economic data to provide context for key findings.

Project Overview
This dashboard serves as a hands-on showcase of my skills as a dedicated Data Scientist and Data Analyst. It demonstrates the ability to transform complex, localized data into clear, actionable intelligence tailored for a specific region.

The project highlights proficiency in:

Data Modeling and Transformation: Implementing robust ETL processes for data cleansing, structuring, and optimizing the data model for Maji Ndogo's data sources.

DAX Expertise: Utilization of advanced Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create meaningful calculated measures, columns, and tables necessary for indicator tracking (e.g., year-over-year growth, cumulative totals, and indexing).

Visualization and Storytelling: Designing intuitive, interactive visuals that effectively communicate trends and outliers in public safety and environmental health within Maji Ndogo.
